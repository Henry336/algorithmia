# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Reframed Sorting Slime as a Queueworks intake-ordering repair.
- Replaced the demo solution with manual insertion-sort logic.
- Rejected `sorted(...)` and `.sort()` for Sorting Slime submissions.
- Added CLI and sorting-helper regression coverage.
- Moved Python helper restrictions into encounter metadata so future encounters can set their own rules.
- Hardened Sorting Slime helper rejection so a simple alias of `sorted` is rejected too.
- Added `Triage Line Dispatcher Trial` as a second CLI encounter with urgent-ticket ordering, stable ties, and the two-urgent ordinary guard.
- Added encounter selection with `python -m algorithimia --encounter triage_line`.
- Improved the Triage CLI trace so it previews the ordinary-guard case with arrival, urgent override, stable tie, ordinary guard, and served labels.
- Added renderer-ready trace events with stable kinds, player-facing labels, and metadata payloads while preserving the current CLI trace text.
- Added validator-linked Triage debrief barks for buried urgency, broken stable ties, ordinary starvation, FIFO drift, and ticket identity mistakes.
- Added a static browser trace viewer export with embedded Phase 1 badge and trace-event icons through `--trace-html`.
