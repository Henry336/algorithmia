# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Reframed Sorting Slime as a Queueworks intake-ordering repair.
- Replaced the demo solution with manual insertion-sort logic.
- Rejected `sorted(...)` and `.sort()` for Sorting Slime submissions.
- Added CLI and sorting-helper regression coverage.
- Moved Python helper restrictions into encounter metadata so future encounters can set their own rules.
- Hardened Sorting Slime helper rejection so a simple alias of `sorted` is rejected too.
- Added `Triage Line Dispatcher Trial` as a second CLI encounter with urgent-ticket ordering, stable ties, and the two-urgent ordinary guard.
- Added encounter selection with `python -m algorithimia --encounter triage_line`.
- Improved the Triage CLI trace so it previews the ordinary-guard case with arrival, urgent override, stable tie, ordinary guard, and served labels.
- Added renderer-ready trace events with stable kinds, player-facing labels, and metadata payloads while preserving the current CLI trace text.
- Added validator-linked Triage debrief barks for buried urgency, broken stable ties, ordinary starvation, FIFO drift, and ticket identity mistakes.
- Added a static browser trace viewer export with embedded Phase 1 badge and trace-event icons through `--trace-html`.
- Hardened Sorting Slime again so indirect built-in `sorted` bindings through default arguments, lambda arguments, or tuple indexing are rejected.
- Added a GitHub Actions unit-test workflow for Python 3.11 pushes and pull requests.
- Hardened the Python adapter preflight so imports, dunder introspection, and dynamic evaluation/introspection helpers are rejected before player code runs.
- Added source-size and result-payload caps to the Python adapter to limit oversized local submissions and outputs.
- Added Sorting Slime certification cases so hard-coded answers for the public examples do not clear the encounter.
- Marked certification results separately from public teaching cases and sealed their CLI expected/actual values so hidden validation inputs are not exposed.
- Added a sealed-certification summary to the static trace viewer for encounters with hidden certification cases.
- Added a static browser game shell export with tabbed encounter selection, trace previews, run commands, embedded Phase 1 assets, and sealed-certification status.
- Added a browser-playable Sorting Slime swap/check slice inside the game shell with the Sorting Slime scene strip, Queueworks gate art, Sorting Slime placeholder art, visible rune tokens, Mira feedback, and reset/check controls.
- Added visible jammed/cleared route status and adjacent inspection marks to the browser-playable Sorting Slime slice.
- Added a tiny explorable Queueworks room to the browser game shell with player movement, an interactable Sorting Slime, Agent 5's room-sheet Patchrunner/prompt art, encounter transition, success return, and route-open room feedback.
- Wired Agent 5's Queueworks room feedback sheet and retry strip into the browser shell, then added wrong-order return-to-room retry feedback so failed repairs keep the intake visibly jammed.
- Added basic blocked-tile collision to the Queueworks room and made the jammed route blockers clear after a successful Sorting Slime repair.
- Added simple blocked tiles and collision feedback to the Queueworks room so the Patchrunner navigates around the Sorting Slime, jammed gate, and ledger clutter instead of walking through them.
