# Architecture

Algorithimia currently uses a small Python package organized around a deterministic encounter loop.

## Modules

- `algorithimia.cli`: terminal entry point.
- `algorithimia.encounters`: encounter data and test cases.
- `algorithimia.engine`: gameplay validation flow.
- `algorithimia.language.python_adapter`: Python-first player-code execution.
- `algorithimia.visualizers`: deterministic trace events and text labels for algorithm feedback.
- `algorithimia.trace_viewer`: static HTML trace viewer export for the current structured event stream.

## Gameplay Flow

1. The CLI loads an encounter.
2. The engine sends each case to the language adapter.
3. The adapter executes `solve(values)` in a child Python process.
4. The engine optionally applies encounter-specific output validation.
5. The engine compares JSON-compatible output against expected case results.
6. The CLI prints RPG-flavored feedback and per-case results.

## Encounter Validation Policy

`Sorting Slime` is a DSA teaching encounter, so its encounter metadata defines Python call restrictions that reject `sorted(...)`, simple aliases of `sorted`, and `.sort()` before executing player code. The engine passes those restrictions to the Python adapter per attempt, keeping helper bans encounter-scoped for future challenges.

`Triage Line Dispatcher Trial` uses the same engine path with JSON ticket objects instead of integer rune values. Its output validator checks that returned ids were issued by the fixture and that every issued ticket is served exactly once before the expected policy order is compared. If the ids are valid but the order is wrong, the validator returns a compact encounter bark tied to the failed policy case: FIFO drift, buried urgency, broken stable ties, or ordinary starvation.

Encounter metadata can name a `trace_case_name` when the most useful preview is not the first non-empty fixture. Triage Line uses this to show the ordinary-guard fixture in the CLI trace, including arrival, urgent override, stable tie, ordinary guard, and served labels.

## Trace Visualizer Contract

Visualizers now expose renderer-ready `TraceEvent` values with:

- `kind`: a stable event category such as `comparison`, `arrival`, `urgent_override`, `stable_tie`, `ordinary_guard`, or `served`.
- `label`: the compact terminal string players see today.
- `payload`: JSON-compatible details a future renderer can bind to sprites, lanes, badges, or animation states.

The CLI still calls `encounter_trace(...)` for labels, but those labels are derived from `encounter_trace_events(...)`. Future graphical clients should consume the structured events instead of scraping terminal text.

`algorithimia.trace_viewer` is the first lightweight browser surface. It renders the selected encounter's current trace events into a self-contained HTML file and embeds the Phase 1 encounter badge plus trace-event SVG sheets as data images. This is deliberately a static viewer, not the final renderer or camera choice.

## Near-Term Extension Points

- Move encounter definitions into data files when content volume grows.
- Add a UI client after the terminal loop proves the core interaction.
- Add more event kinds for graph traversal, stack/deque changes, recursion frames, and dynamic programming tables as those encounters land.
